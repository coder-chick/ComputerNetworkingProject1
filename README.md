# Computer Networking - Project 1 - UDP Socket Programming in Python
Course Materials from the Masters Computer Networking class CS5700 at Northeastern University

A socket programming for UDP in Python where datagram packets are sent and received between Server and Client. The server packet drop rate is simulated to be 30%.  The Round Trip Time (RTT) is calculated for 10 Pings and a proper socket timeput is implemented

## To Execute: 
From the computer terminal or a Python IDE terminal:

1. First run the server. In the terminal, enter:
   * python UDPPingerServer.py 15007
2. Second, run the client. In the terminal, enter:
   * python UDPPingerClient.py localhost 15007
 
## This project contains the following:
1. README.md
2. The Server UDP Pinger Python code --> "UDPPingerServer.py"
